# Self-Playing-Basketball-Game

A basketball game where a basketball will learn through a genetic algorithm how to move itself through a hoop.

Created using pygame, the game is simple, purely having a basketball and a hoop. Points are gained when the basketball moves into the hoop. The machine learning will usee a genetic algorithm to have the ball eventually learn how to move itself into the hoop.

Currently working on: Implementing a genetic algorithm into the already completed game.
